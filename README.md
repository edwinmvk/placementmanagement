## Introduction

This is a web application built with React and Javascript to ease and organize the process of placement drives for students of Jyothi Engineering College. The build tool used is [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). [AntDesign](https://ant.design/) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) are used for the component library and styling, respectively. The server is built using [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en). This repository contains the source code for the app.

## Prerequisites

Before running this project, make sure you have the following software installed on your system:

- Node.js (v18.14.2 or higher)
- pnpm (v8.2.0 or higher)

## Installation

**NB**: All the mentioned steps must be done within the `main` branch only.
To get started with the app, you will need to clone this repository and install the dependencies. You can do this by running the following commands in your terminal:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/emvk09/react-placementmanagement.git
cd react-placementmanagement
```

In the `client` directory, install client dependencies,

```sh
pnpm install
```

In the `server` directory, install server dependencies,

```sh
pnpm install
```

## Setting Environment Variables

In `client` directory, create a file `.env.local`

From your Firebase console, create a new project and add Firebase to your webapp in the project settings. Collect your web app's Firebase configuration and add the following in the file.

```sh
VITE_APIKEY=*******************
VITE_AUTHDOMAIN=***************
VITE_PROJECTID=****************
VITE_STORAGEBUCKET=************
VITE_MESSAGINGSENDERID=********
VITE_APPID=********************
VITE_SERVER_DOMAIN=http://localhost:3000
```

In `server` directory, create a file `.env`

Make sure you signup for a Cloudinary account and Mongodb Atlas. Collect the secret keys and urls, and add the following in the file.

```sh
MONGODB_URL=*******************
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=*********
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=************
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=*********
JWT_SECRET=********************
CLIENT_DOMAIN=http://localhost:5173
```

JWT_SECRET can be given as a random string of any length.
e.g., `JWT_SECRET=hjimwmwmo-2m0sls_2ksksskwd`

## Usage

Once you have installed the dependencies and set the environment variables, you can run the server by running the following command from the `server` directory:

```sh
pnpm dev
```

You can then run the client by running the following command from the `client` directory:

```sh
pnpm run dev
```

This will start the client and open the app in your default browser. This may take 2-3 minutes.

**NB**: **Make sure the server runs in PORT: `3000` and client runs in `http://localhost:5173` to avoid any CORS errors**

## Building

If you want to build the app for production, you can run the following command from the `client` directory:

```sh
pnpm run build
```

This will generate a production-ready build of the app in the `dist` directory.
